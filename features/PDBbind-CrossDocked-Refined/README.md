### The results are based on the cross-docked/re-docked poses generated by Surflex-Dock.

***the cross-native poses have been removed.***  

**e.g. pid_id = "1000_4ra1_4zeb"**      
1. "1000" represents the ID of the clusters, and the complexes that owin the same ID are grouped in the same cluster.     
2. "4ra1" represents the PDB ID of the protein while "4zeb" represents the PDB ID of the ligand, which means that the ligand of 4zeb is docked into the pocket of 4ra1.
