##The results are based on the cross-docked/re-docked poses generated by Surflex-Dock.

##the cross-native poses have been removed.


pid_id = "1000_4ra1_4zeb": "1000" represents the ID of the clusters, and the complexes that owin the same ID are grouped in the same cluster.
						"4ra1" represents the PDB ID of the protein while "4zeb" represents the PDB ID of the ligand, which means that
						 the ligand of 4zeb is docked into the pocket of 4ra1.
						


rmsd_statistics.csv.bz2            			  ---  RMSD value of each pose.
rmsd_statistics_surflex.csv.bz2               ---  when using Surflex-Dock for rescoring, it will minimize the poses,
											  so the RMSDs of those native poses not always equal to 0.
NNscore2_refinedcrossdock.csv.bz2             ---  the features of NNscore.   "vina_affinity","vina_gauss_1","vina_gauss_2",
											  "vina_repulsion","vina_hydrophobic",and "vina_hydrogen" are used as Vina features.
NNscore2vina_refinedcrossdock.csv.bz2         ---  the features of Vina extracted from NNscore. 

ecif_ecif_refinedcrossdock.csv.bz2            ---  the features of ECIF.
