### The results are based on the cross-docked/re-docked poses generated by Autodock Vina.

**e.g. pid_id = "10_3p5o_4lzs"**      
1. "10" represents the ID of the clusters, and the complexes that own the same ID are grouped in the same cluster.     
2. "3p5o" represents the PDB ID of the protein, while "4lzs" represents the PDB ID of the ligand, which means that the ligand of 4lzs is docked into the pocket of 3p5o.
