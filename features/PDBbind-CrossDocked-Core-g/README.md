##The results are based on the cross-docked/re-docked poses generated by Glide SP.

pid_id = "10_3p5o_4lzs": "10" represents the ID of the clusters, and the complexes that owin the same ID are grouped in the same cluster.
						"3p5o" represents the PDB ID of the protein while "4lzs" represents the PDB ID of the ligand, which means that
						 the ligand of 4lzs is docked into the pocket of 3p5o.
						

glide_rmsd_statistics.csv            		  ---  RMSD value of each pose.

glide_scores.csv.bz2                          ---  the scores from Glide SP. "docking_score" is finally utilized.
prime-mmgbsa_casfcrossdockg.csv.bz2           ---  the scores of Prime-MM/GBSA.   "r_psp_MMGBSA_dG_Bind" is the final scores.
xscore_casfcrossdockg.csv                     ---  the scores of X-Score.   "average_score" is used as the final scores.
